            <p>In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.
                In the example below, the WarningBanner is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render:</p>   
            
        </div>
